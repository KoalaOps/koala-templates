# Hello World {{serviceName}} Express App
{{koalaTemplate}}
A simple Node.js application using Express to serve a "Hello, World!" message. This template can be used as a base for new Node.js projects.

## Project Structure

- `package.json` - Manages project dependencies and scripts.
- `index.js` - Main application file that sets up a basic Express server.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the Server**

    Start the server using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **View the Application**

    Open your browser and go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

    You should see the message:

    ```
    Hello, World!
    ```

## Customization

- Modify the `port` variable in `index.js` if you want to use a different port.
- Update routes and responses in `index.js` to customize the server output.

Use this template as a starting point for your own Node.js applications with Express.
