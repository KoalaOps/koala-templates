    <h1>404 Page - Use Cases and Best Practices</h1>

        <h2>General Use for "Not Found" Cases</h2>
        <p>
            A 404 error page is displayed when a user attempts to access a page that does not exist on the server.
            This typically occurs when:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The URL is typed incorrectly.</li>
            <li>A resource has been moved or deleted without proper redirection.</li>
            <li>A broken or outdated link leads to the website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The purpose of a 404 page is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inform the user that the requested resource could not be found.</li>
            <li>Provide options or links to guide the user back to functional parts of the website.</li>
            <li>Maintain a consistent branding and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>404 Page for Single Page Applications (SPAs)</h2>
        <p>
            In Single Page Applications (SPAs), all navigation and content rendering is typically handled by JavaScript
            on the client side. This can cause a problem with 404 errors, as direct access to specific routes may bypass
            the SPA’s routing logic, leading to a "not found" error from the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent this, the server should be configured to serve the main <code>index.html</code> file for any unknown routes.
            The SPA can then handle the routing internally. Here’s how a 404 page is used in SPAs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If a user accesses a route (e.g., <code>/about</code> or <code>/profile</code>) directly, the server
                should return the main <code>index.html</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The SPA's JavaScript router inspects the route and displays the correct content, or redirects to
                a custom "Page Not Found" component for invalid routes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This approach ensures that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All valid routes are handled correctly by the SPA.</li>
            <li>Custom 404 logic is implemented within the application for invalid routes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Example Configuration for SPAs</h2>
        <p>
            In the Nginx configuration, you can use the following directive to enable SPA routing:
        </p>
        <pre>
        location / {
            try_files $uri /index.html;
        }
        </pre>
        <p>
            This ensures that all routes are served the main <code>index.html</code>, allowing the SPA to handle
            navigation and 404 cases internally.
